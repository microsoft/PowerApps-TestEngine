# Power Apps Test Engine

[![CI Build](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-TestEngine/actions/workflows/build-test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-TestEngine/actions/workflows/build-test.yml)
> This is currently an experimental project.

Power Apps Test Engine is an open source project that provides a way for makers to run tests authored using Power FX against Canvas apps. These tests are written in our Power FX expression language.

The engine uses Playwright to orchestrate the tests.

## Getting Started

To get started with running one of the samples

### Build locally

Note: You may need to change your `MSBuildSDKsPath` environment variable to point to [.NET Core 6.0.x SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) if it is set to a different .NET Core SDK version.

```bash
# Pull github repo
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-TestEngine.git

# Change to the PowerAppsTestEngine folder
cd PowerApps-TestEngine\src\PowerAppsTestEngine

# Build
dotnet build

# Install required browsers - replace netX with actual output folder name, eg. net6.0.
pwsh bin\Debug\netX\playwright.ps1 install
```

### Import a sample solution

Log in to Power Apps with a work or school organization account. The account used cannot have multi-factor authentication enabled for use with Power Apps. For Microsoft employees, you will need to create a test account.

If you need a test tenant, you can create one by visiting [this](https://cdx.transform.microsoft.com/my-tenants).

Import the solution of a sample(Eg. `PowerApps-TestEngine\samples\basicgallery\BasicGallery_1_0_0_2.zip`). Remember the environment that you imported the solution to. For information about solution import, please view [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/maker/data-platform/import-update-export-solutions). Check [Samples Introduction](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-TestEngine/blob/main/samples/SamplesIntroduction.md) for more sample solutions.

### Set up the config file

Create a `config.dev.json` inside the `PowerAppsTestEngine` folder. (It should be next to the config.json)

The contents should be a copy of config.json, like this.
```
{
  "environmentId": "",
  "tenantId": "",
  "testPlanFile": "",
  "outputDirectory": ""
}
```

Fill in the various properties:

- environmentId: Environment that you imported the solution to
  - You can get the `environmentId` by visiting [this](https://make.powerapps.com/). Make sure to select the environment you import the solution to. In the URL, you will be able to find the `environmentId`. (Eg. https://make.powerapps.com/environments/{environmentId}/solutions/)
- tenantId: Tenant you are in
  - Select the solution imported and visit the `Details` of the solution. `tenantId` can be found in `Web link`.
- testPlanFile: Path to the `testPlan.fx.yaml` file for the sample that you wish to run. (Eg. `../../samples/basicgallery/testPlan.fx.yaml`)
- outputDirectory: Path to folder you wish the test results to be placed.

For more information about the config and the inputs to the command, please view [this](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-TestEngine/blob/main/docs/CommandInput.md)

To setup the user environment variables, please view [this](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-TestEngine/blob/main/docs/Yaml/Users.md). Refer to the user configuration section in your selected sample's `testPlan.fx.yaml`.

### Run test

Now you should be ready to run the test
```
# Run test
dotnet run
```

When the run is complete, you should be able to view the test results in the folder you specified earlier.
