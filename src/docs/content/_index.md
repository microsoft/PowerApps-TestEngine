Welcome to the Power Apps Test Engine! Our goal is to provide you with the tools and knowledge to effectively apply low code testing in your projects.

Not sure where to start have a look at our [Getting Started Guide](/PowerApps-TestEngine/context/getting-started/).

## Understand the Context

The [Context](./context/) section of this site is designed to give you background and delve into the people and process aspects of the Development / Operations (DevOps) loop. 

It will help you understand the why and how parts of the process. The discussion and example sections will expand on this context with areas of discussion as you work through this journey and provide examples of how you can do it. Any DevOps journey is a transformation, especially as we look at low code where the speed of development is fast and many of the learnings and principles are new to people.
