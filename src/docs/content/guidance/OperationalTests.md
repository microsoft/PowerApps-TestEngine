# Operational Team Requirements

The operations team could be the original maker or a dedicated team that is responsible for continuous test execution of tests to verify and maintain the health of the deployed solution. Key requirements include:
-	Monitoring test results and system performance metrics.
-	Scheduling regular test runs to detect and address issues proactively.
-	Ensuring test environments are aligned with production settings.

This process extends beyond the initial deployment of the solution but throughout out its entire operational lifetime. Over the life of the solution many changes can occur. For example, changing business requirements, changes in the maker team owning and supporting the solution, updated product features, and updated tenant and environment configurations may necessitate adjustments to the testing and operational processes. The operations team must be prepared to adapt to these changes to ensure the continued reliability and performance of the solution.

By adopting a continuous integration and deployment process these changing operational scenarios can be considered to provide a set of automated tests that provide confidence that the solution continues to work as expected.
