This context part of the site is designed to give you background and look more at the people and process parts of the Development / Operations (DevOps) loop and help you understand the why and how parts of the process. The discussion and example sections will expand on this context with areas of discussion as you work through this journey and provide examples of how you can do it. Any DevOps journey is a transformation, especially as we look at low code where the speed of development is fast and many of the learnings and principles are new to people. 

## Why Testing Matters

In the realm of low code development, testing is often an overlooked yet crucial aspect. Ensuring the reliability, performance, and security of your Power Platform solutions can significantly enhance their quality and user satisfaction. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting, understanding and implementing robust testing strategies is key to delivering top-notch solutions.

## The Transformation Power of AI

AI plays a pivotal role in this journey, offering tools and capabilities that can significantly enhance the testing process. From automating repetitive tasks to providing intelligent insights, AI can help streamline your DevOps practices and ensure your solutions are robust and reliable.

## Topics to frame Automated Testing

Before you dive into deeper discussion and examples you the following articles to help frame the discussion. These topics should help you have discussions with Enterprise Architect, Solution Architects and IT decision makers on how Power Platform and Automated Testing applies when looking at the Power Platform

| Article | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| [Why Automated Testing](./why-automated-testing.md) | Automated testing is essential for ensuring the reliability, security, and performance of applications. It provides a safety net that catches bugs early, reduces manual testing efforts, and ensures consistent quality. This is particularly important in the context of low-code Power Platform solutions, where rapid development cycles can lead to overlooked issues. |
| [Why Not Just Manual Testing](./why-not-just-manual-testing.md) | While manual testing has its place, it is often time-consuming, prone to human error, and not scalable for large or complex applications. Automated testing complements manual testing by handling repetitive tasks, providing faster feedback, and allowing testers to focus on more critical, exploratory testing activities. |
| [Growing to Enterprise Grade](./growing-to-enterprise-grade.md) | As solutions scale, the need for robust testing practices becomes more critical. This article explores how to transition from small-scale projects to enterprise-grade solutions, emphasizing the importance of automated testing in maintaining high standards of reliability, security, and performance. |
| [Impacts on People, Process, and Tooling](./impacts-on-people-process-and-tooling.md) | Implementing automated testing requires a shift in mindset and practices. This article discusses the cultural and organizational changes needed to adopt automated testing, the impact on development and operations processes, and the tools that can facilitate this transformation. |
| [Transformative Power of AI](./transformative-power-of-ai.md) | This article explores how AI can observe interactions and inform the agent to suggest happy paths, edge cases, and exception cases. This capability helps deliver a faster path to generate comprehensive test scenarios, enhancing the overall testing process. |
| [Why Not Just Use Code First Testing Tools](./why-not-just-use-code-first-testing-tools.md) | Code-first testing resources are relatively scarce, and the efficiency of building low-code solutions must be matched by the rapid creation of tests. This article explains why relying solely on code-first testing tools may not be sufficient and how low-code testing tools can complement them. |
| [Roadmap Alignment](./roadmap-alignment.md) | Set context on how the work we are investing in for the CoE Starter Kit aligns with the wider Power Platform Automated testing roadmap. |
| [Low code Testing Principles](./low-code-test-design-principles.md) | These principles provide a structured framework for creating robust tests that validate the functionality and performance of low-code applications. |
