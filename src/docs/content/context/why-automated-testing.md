title:  Why Automated Testing?
---

Automated testing is a cornerstone of modern software development, ensuring that applications are [sustainable](../discussion/building-a-sustainability-model.md), reliable, secure, and performance. In the context of low-code Power Platform solutions, automated testing becomes even more critical due to the rapid development cycles and the need for enterprise-grade reliability.

## Learned Expectations of Automated Testing

In traditional software development, automated testing has proven to be invaluable for catching bugs early, reducing manual testing efforts, and ensuring consistent quality. These benefits are equally applicable to low-code solutions, where the speed of development can sometimes lead to overlooked issues. Automated tests provide a safety net, ensuring that new features do not break existing functionality and that the application remains robust as it evolves.

## Applying Automated Testing to Enterprise-Grade Low-Code Solutions

For enterprise-grade low-code solutions, automated testing is essential to maintain high standards of reliability and security. It supports the pillars of the [Power Well-Architected Framework](https://aka.ms/powa), particularly Operational Excellence, Security, and Reliability.

## Operational Excellence

Automated testing enhances operational excellence by streamlining the development process. It allows for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), ensuring that code changes are automatically tested and deployed with confidence. This reduces the risk of human error and accelerates the release cycle, enabling teams to deliver features faster and with higher quality.

## Security

Security is another critical pillar supported by automated testing. By incorporating security tests into the automated testing suite, teams can ensure that their applications are resilient to attacks and comply with security best practices. Automated tests can simulate various attack scenarios, validate access controls, and ensure that data integrity and confidentiality are maintained.

## Reliability

Reliability design principles emphasize the need for a resilient and available system. Automated testing contributes to this by continuously validating the system's ability to handle faults and recover from failures. It ensures that the application can consistently deliver functionality and meet the agreed quality levels.

## Testing Personas and Roles

Automated testing also plays a pivotal role in validating different personas and roles within the application. It ensures that each user type can perform their tasks without issues, maintaining a seamless user experience across the board.

## Continuous Integration / Deployment (CI/CD) and Deployment Confidence

The CI/CD process is integral to maintaining deployment confidence. Automated tests are a key component of this process, providing immediate feedback on the impact of code changes. This continuous validation helps teams identify and address issues early, ensuring that deployments are smooth and reliable.

## Keep It Simple Principle

The "Keep it simple" principle is crucial in automated testing. By leveraging in-product experiences to build, maintain, and execute tests, teams can avoid reinventing the wheel. This approach ensures that testing processes are straightforward, efficient, and aligned with the overall development workflow.

## Conclusion

In summary, automated testing is not just a best practice but a necessity for building and maintaining enterprise-grade low-code solutions. It supports the pillars of the Power Well-Architected Framework, ensuring operational excellence, security, and reliability. By integrating automated testing into the development process, teams can deliver high-quality applications that meet business requirements and provide a robust user experience.
