# Understanding the Journey from Manual Testing to Automated Testing

## Introduction

Adopting automated testing can be a transformative journey for any organization. This journey involves several stages, each with its own set of challenges and opportunities. In this article, we will explore the key factors that influence the journey from manual testing to automated testing, highlighting both positive and negative impacts. This understanding will help you complete a self-assessment and make informed decisions to improve your testing processes.

## Key Factors and Their Impact

### Adoption Stages

1. **Early Adopter**: 
   - **Characteristics**: Willing to work at the cutting edge and help shape the direction. Not all features may be complete, and alternative workarounds may be necessary. More weighted towards code-first personas for people building tests as features like record and replay and AI-generated tests develop.
   - **Challenges**: Initial hesitation, incomplete features, and need for workarounds.
   - **Opportunities**: Influence the development of new features and gain early benefits from automation.

2. **Beta User**: 
   - **Characteristics**: Comfortable working with experimental features that may change based on feedback.
   - **Challenges**: Inconsistent implementation and potential changes in features.
   - **Opportunities**: Provide feedback to improve features and adapt to new functionalities.

3. **General Availability**: 
   - **Characteristics**: Wait longer but take advantage of features that are ready for wider usage.
   - **Challenges**: May miss out on early benefits and innovations.
   - **Opportunities**: Stable and well-tested features with fewer disruptions.

### Common Blockers

1. **Initial Hesitation and Resistance**: Teams may resist change due to fear of the unknown and lack of understanding of automated testing benefits.
2. **Lack of Clear Strategy**: Inconsistent implementation and lack of proper tools and training can lead to frustration and abandonment of the initiative.
3. **Inadequate Resources and Support**: Limited resources, lack of support from management, and insufficient budget for necessary tools and training.
4. **Poor Communication and Collaboration**: Misalignment of goals, duplicated efforts, and unresolved issues cause delays and inefficiencies.
5. **Failure to Measure and Improve**: No clear metrics to demonstrate the value of automation, leading to skepticism and eventual discontinuation of the initiative.

### Mitigation Approaches

1. **Record and Replay**: Helps with test case generation and reduces the manual effort required.
2. **Generative AI**: Identifies and addresses potential negative experiences, converting them into positive outcomes.
3. **Training and Resources**: Enhances the understanding and skills of both low-code makers and code-first developers.
4. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Ensures alignment of goals and expectations with business stakeholders.
5. **Collaboration Tools**: Facilitates effective communication and coordination among teams.

## The Journey Path

The journey from manual testing to automated testing can be visualized through different stages:

1. **Initial Adoption**: This stage involves the initial implementation of automated testing. Teams may face hesitation and resistance, but with the right mitigators, they can overcome these challenges.
2. **Peak of Expectations**: At this stage, teams have high expectations from automated testing. Proper strategy, resources, and support are crucial to meet these expectations.
3. **Disillusionment and Productivity**: Teams may face disillusionment if the implementation does not meet expectations. However, with continuous measurement and improvement, they can achieve productivity and realize the full benefits of automated testing.

## Encouragement for Self-Assessment

Understanding these factors and their impact will help you complete the self-assessment survey. By identifying your adoption stage, common blockers, and potential mitigators, you can gain insights into your journey and make informed decisions to improve your testing processes. Use the survey to reflect on your experiences and identify areas for improvement.
