title: Maintainability of Low Code Solutions Using Automation
---

## Introduction
In today's fast-paced digital landscape, maintaining low code solutions efficiently is crucial for ensuring seamless operations and continuous innovation. Automation plays a pivotal role in enhancing the maintainability and [sustainability](./building-a-sustainability-model.md) of these solutions by streamlining processes, reducing manual efforts, and ensuring consistency across various environments.

## The Role of Infrastructure as Code

### Automated Provisioning of Test Environments
[Infrastructure as Code (IaC)](../examples/coe-kit-infrastructure-as-code.md) is van be key enabler for automating the provisioning of test environments. By defining infrastructure configurations in code, teams can create consistent and repeatable environments with the necessary settings, dependencies, and solution installations. This automated process helps in establishing a robust test matrix that validates installations globally, allowing teams to proactively identify and address issues.

### Proactive Testing Environment
Having a proactive testing environment is essential for running tests against various configurations to determine potential issues. IaC facilitates the creation of such environments, ensuring that tests are conducted in a controlled and consistent manner. This approach not only saves time but also enhances the reliability of the testing process.

## Shift Left Testing Strategy
### Different Levels of Testing
Adopting a "shift left" [testing strategy](./implementing-effective-automated-testing-strategies-in-power-platform-solutions.md) involves integrating testing activities early in the development lifecycle. Automated testing principles can be applied to various levels of testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. By shifting testing to the left, teams can identify and resolve issues earlier, reducing the risk of defects in the final product.

### Automated Testing as a Key Tool
Automated testing is a crucial tool for solutions especially at enterprise scale to ensure that support issues and new features are thoroughly tested before release. It enables different teams to build and continue enhancing the features of the solution with confidence. Automated tests provide a safety net that catches regressions and ensures that new changes do not introduce unexpected issues.

## The Role of Test Automation
### Describing System Behavior
Test automation makes it easier for different teams to describe what the system does and how it is expected to work. By automating tests, teams can create a living documentation of the system's behavior, which serves as a reference for making changes and understanding the impact of those changes.

### Facilitating Changes
Automated tests provide a clear and concise way to validate that the system works as intended. This clarity makes it easier for teams to implement changes, knowing that the automated tests will catch any deviations from the expected behavior. As a result, teams can iterate faster and with greater confidence.
