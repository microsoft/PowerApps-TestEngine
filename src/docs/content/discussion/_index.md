Welcome to our community-driven discussions site, where we dive deeper into topics applying testing to the Power Platform. This site is designed to foster a starting point for engaging discussions, were articles can be used to share insights, and collaboratively explore how testing concepts can be effectively applied to the solutions you build and maintain.

## Why Testing Matters

In the realm of low code development, testing is often an overlooked yet crucial aspect. Ensuring the reliability, performance, and security of your Power Platform solutions can significantly enhance their quality and user satisfaction. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting, understanding and implementing robust testing strategies is key to delivering top-notch applications.

## Discussion Topics

### Current Topics

| Article | Notes |
|---------|-------|
[Building a Sustainability Model](./building-a-sustainability-model.md) | In the fast-paced world of software development, the initial rush of quickly building and deploying a solution can be exhilarating. However, the true challenge lies in keeping your great idea alive and ensuring its sustainability over time. This discussion explores how to build a sustainability model that not only keeps your solution relevant but also engages the community and stakeholders in the process. |
[Embracing Testing Strategies for Low-Code Solutions: A Discussion for Enterprise Architects](./enterprise-architecture-discussion.md) | This discussion provides Enterprise Architects and related roles an overview of testing strategies for low-code solutions on the Power Platform, emphasizing the importance of automated testing, scalability, and integration with existing systems. It highlights key principles and practices to ensure that low-code applications are reliable, secure, and aligned with organizational goals.|
[Implementing Effective Automated Testing Strategies in Power Platform Solutions](./implementing-effective-automated-testing-strategies-in-power-platform-solutions.md) | Automated testing is a crucial aspect of modern software development, ensuring the reliability and efficiency of solutions. This discussion explores how to implement effective automated testing strategies in Power Platform solutions, using the CoE Starter Kit Setup and Upgrade wizard as an example. We will discuss the layers of automated testing across Power Apps, Power Automate, and Dataverse. |
| [Does Every Solution Need Automated Testing?](./does-every-solution-need-automated-testing.md) | Automated testing, with its promise of efficiency and reliability, has become a cornerstone of modern development practices. However, the necessity and extent of its application can vary significantly depending on the context and nature of the project. |
| [Exploring Generative AI with Power Apps Test Engine](./generative-ai.md) | As part of our proposed session, we could dive into the transformative capabilities of Generative AI within the Power Apps Test Engine. This discussion could highlight key scenarios: using Generative AI to convert natural language into defined test steps and leveraging AI Builder prompts to create and measure the potential business value of low-code solutions against Objectives and Key Results (OKRs). |
[Introduction to Testing Approaches](./introduction-to-testing-approaches.md) | Read discussion and give your feedback on the concepts of automated testing looking at concepts like black box and white box testing for Power Apps, including Canvas Apps, Custom Pages, and Model Driven Applications. We'll explore the importance of state management, connectors, workflows, and Dataverse state, and how to effectively test these components. |
[Low Code Power Platform Testing for the Code First Developer](./low-code-testing-for-code-first-developer.md) | This article is intended as a starter for discussion and contains content that is under development. It is based on experiences from teams like the Power CAT Engineering team as they apply low code testing principles to the low code Power Platform solutions they build and maintain. Ideally, this discussion serves as a great starting point to foster collaboration and gain input to help shape low code automation and engineering excellence in the wider low code Power Platform community. |
[Playwright vs Power Apps Test Engine](./playwright-vs-test-engine.md) | When it comes to testing low-code Power Platform applications, a common question arises: why not just use Playwright to directly test a Power App rather than using the Power Apps Test Engine? This discussion aims to explore the strengths and limitations of both tools and provide insights into their best use cases. | 
| [Authentication in Power Apps Test Engine](./authentication.md) | Authentication is a critical component of the test automation process. The sample script employs browser-based authentication, which offers a range of options to authenticate with Microsoft Entra. This method generates a persistent browser cookie, allowing for non-interactive execution of subsequent tests. The management of these browser cookies is governed by the guidelines provided in the Microsoft Entra documentation on session lifetime and conditional access policies. |
| [Data Simulation](./data-simulation.md) | This discussion aims to explore the concepts of data simulation and mocking in the context of low code solutions, particularly focusing on Power Fx commands for Dataverse calls, connectors, and workflows. | 
| [Test Authoring](./test-authoring.md) | In this discussion, we will explore the overview of authoring test cases using the Test Engine. We will delve into various aspects such as the CoE Kit Test Case Authoring, discoverability of visual elements, Test Studio, and the settings and configurations of the Test Engine. Additionally, we will discuss the role of Generative AI in enhancing the test authoring process. | 

### Future Topics

Possible future topics could be on a variety of topics, including but not limited to:

- **Tool Selection**: What tools to pick and why considerations might you need to make?
- **Unit Testing**: How can we apply unit testing principles to Power Apps and Power Automate flows?
- **Integration Testing**: What are the best practices for testing integrations with other systems and services?
- **Security Testing**: What strategies can we use to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities?
- **Automated Testing**: When should you and how can we leverage automated testing tools to streamline our testing processes?
- **CI/CD**: How to integrate these concepts into your build and release process and how does this affect your operations model.
