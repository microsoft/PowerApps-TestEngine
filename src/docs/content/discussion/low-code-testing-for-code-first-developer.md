## Expectations of a Code First Development Solution

Before we dive into low code Power Platform testing, let's first explore the common norms and expectations of a code-first developer and related personas when performing automated testing of solutions. 

Code-first developers, support engineers, DevOps engineers, and architects typically adhere to a set of best practices and standards to ensure the quality and reliability of their solutions. These expectations include:

### Comprehensive Test Coverage

One of the primary expectations is to achieve comprehensive test coverage. This means writing tests that cover all critical functionalities of the application, including edge cases and potential failure points. The goal is to ensure that every part of the code is tested and any issues are identified early in the development process.

### Consistent and Repeatable Tests

Automated tests should be consistent and repeatable. This means that running the same tests multiple times should yield the same results, regardless of the environment or conditions. Consistency is crucial for identifying genuine issues and avoiding false positives or negatives.

### Integration with CI/CD Pipelines

Automated tests are expected to be integrated into Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. This integration allows for continuous testing, ensuring that any changes to the codebase are automatically tested before being deployed. It helps in maintaining the stability and reliability of the application.

### Clear and Actionable Test Results

Test results should be clear and actionable. Developers and related personas expect detailed reports that highlight any issues, including the specific parts of the code that failed and the reasons for the failure. This information is essential for quickly identifying and resolving problems.

### Maintenance of Test Scripts

Maintaining test scripts is another critical expectation. As the application evolves, test scripts need to be updated to reflect changes in the codebase. Regular maintenance ensures that tests remain relevant and effective in identifying issues.

### Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing

Collaboration and knowledge sharing are vital in the testing process. Developers, support engineers, DevOps engineers, and architects are expected to work together, share insights, and learn from each other's experiences. This collaborative approach helps in improving testing practices and achieving better outcomes.

### Adherence to Best Practices

Finally, adherence to best practices is a fundamental expectation. This includes following coding standards, using appropriate testing frameworks, and leveraging tools that enhance the testing process. Best practices ensure that the testing process is efficient, effective, and aligned with industry standards.

## Introduction to Low Code Power Platform Testing

Low code Power Platform testing can be a crucial aspect of the development lifecycle, especially in today's fast-paced software development environment. It allows developers to create and execute tests with minimal hand-coding, making it accessible to both novice and experienced developers. The benefits of low code testing tools include faster test creation, easier maintenance, and the ability to involve a broader range of team members in the testing process.

But does everything need to be tested? The answer depends on the type of solution and its intended use. For personal productivity solutions, the testing requirements might be less stringent. These solutions are often used by a single individual or a small team, and the impact of any issues is relatively contained. In such cases, basic testing to ensure functionality and usability might suffice.

On the other hand, solutions that need to be handed off to a support team require more thorough testing. These solutions are typically used by a larger group of people, and any issues can lead to increased support requests and potential downtime. Comprehensive testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance tests, is essential to ensure the solution is robust and reliable before it is handed over to the support team.

For enterprise-grade applications that the business relies on, rigorous testing is non-negotiable. These applications are critical to the organization's operations, and any failures can have significant consequences. In addition to the standard tests, performance testing, security testing, and stress testing are crucial to ensure the application can handle the expected load and is secure from potential threats. Continuous testing throughout the development lifecycle helps identify and address issues early, reducing the risk of major problems in production.

In summary, the extent of testing required depends on the solution's scope and impact. Personal productivity solutions may require basic testing, while solutions handed off to support teams and enterprise-grade applications demand comprehensive and rigorous testing to ensure reliability, performance, and security.
