title: Enterprise Architects
---

As an Enterprise Architect, your role is pivotal in ensuring that the technological landscape of your organization is robust, scalable, and aligned with strategic objectives. You are responsible for reviewing and setting implementation plans for content like the pillars of the [Power Well-Architected Framework](https://aka.ms/powa), integrating low-code solutions with existing IT investments, and ensuring holistic integration across both low-code and code-first environments. Your oversight ensures that the organization's technology infrastructure supports business goals and drives innovation.

## Interests and Oversight

### Implementing Quality Control

One of your primary responsibilities is to implement quality control measures that ensure the reliability and performance of low-code solutions. This involves establishing standards and best practices for development, testing, and deployment. Automated testing is a critical component of this quality control framework, providing a systematic approach to validating the functionality and performance of solutions. By incorporating automated tests, you can ensure that solutions meet the required standards and deliver consistent results.

### Integrating with Existing IT Investments

As an Enterprise Architect, you need to ensure that low-code solutions integrate seamlessly with existing IT investments. This includes integrating with automated testing and CI/CD processes, ensuring that low-code solutions can coexist with traditional code-first applications. The "no cliffs" extensibility model facilitates this integration, allowing for a smooth transition between low-code and code-first approaches. Automated testing plays a vital role in this integration by providing a common framework for validating solutions across different environments.

### Ensuring Holistic Integration

Holistic integration is essential for creating a cohesive technology ecosystem. As an Enterprise Architect, you need to ensure that low-code solutions are integrated with other parts of the IT infrastructure, including security, data management, and compliance systems. Automated testing helps achieve this integration by validating that solutions comply with security standards, data privacy regulations, and other organizational policies. This ensures that low-code solutions are secure, compliant, and aligned with the broader IT strategy.

### Leveraging Existing Investments

Your organization has likely made significant investments in automated testing and CI/CD processes. As an Enterprise Architect, you need to leverage these investments to support low-code development. This involves adapting existing testing frameworks and tools to accommodate low-code solutions, ensuring that they benefit from the same rigorous testing and deployment standards as traditional applications. Automated testing provides a bridge between low-code and code-first environments, enabling you to maximize the value of your existing investments.

## The Need for Automated Testing

Automated testing is essential for Enterprise Architects to achieve their goals and ensure the success of low-code solutions. It provides the following benefits:

- **Consistency and Reliability**: Automated tests ensure that solutions behave consistently across different environments and scenarios, reducing the risk of unexpected failures.
- **Efficiency and Speed**: By automating repetitive testing tasks, you can accelerate the development process and bring solutions to market faster.
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated testing provides a robust framework for validating the functionality and performance of solutions, ensuring that they meet the defined requirements.
- **Compliance and Auditability**: Automated tests provide a clear audit trail of testing activities, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements and internal policies.

## Conclusion

As an Enterprise Architect, your role is to ensure that low-code solutions align with the broader organizational strategy and meet the highest standards of quality. By advocating for and overseeing the implementation of automated testing practices, you can ensure that the solutions are reliable, performant, and integrated with existing IT investments. This not only supports business continuity but also drives innovation and strategic growth.
