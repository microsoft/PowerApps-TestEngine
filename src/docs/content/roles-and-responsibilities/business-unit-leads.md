As a Business Unit Lead, your role is critical in bridging the gap between business stakeholders and the teams responsible for developing and deploying low-code solutions. You are tasked with achieving the goals set by business stakeholders while demonstrating the impact and quality of the solutions created. Your oversight ensures that the solutions align with the strategic objectives of the business unit and deliver measurable value.

## Interests and Oversight

### Achieving Business Goals

Your primary responsibility is to ensure that the solutions developed on the Power Platform meet the business goals set by stakeholders. This involves overseeing the development process, ensuring that the solutions are aligned with business objectives, and tracking their performance against key metrics. Automated testing plays a vital role in this process by ensuring that the solutions are reliable, performant, and meet the required standards.

### Demonstrating Impact and Quality

As a Business Unit Lead, you need to demonstrate the impact and quality of the solutions created. This involves providing evidence that the solutions are delivering the expected benefits and meeting the quality standards set by the organization. Automated testing provides a robust framework for validating the functionality and performance of the solutions, ensuring that they meet the defined requirements and deliver consistent results.

### Balancing Competing Priorities

You often have to balance competing priorities within your business unit. This includes managing resources, timelines, and expectations from various stakeholders. Automated testing helps streamline the development process by providing faster feedback and reducing the need for extensive manual testing. This allows your team to focus on delivering high-quality solutions within the set timelines and resource constraints.

### Ensuring Business Continuity

Business continuity is a key concern for any Business Unit Lead. You need to ensure that the solutions developed are resilient and can withstand various operational challenges. Automated testing provides a safety net that ensures new features do not disrupt existing functionality, thereby supporting uninterrupted business operations.

## The Need for Automated Testing

Automated testing is essential for Business Unit Leads to achieve their goals and demonstrate the value of low-code solutions. It provides the following benefits:

- **Reliability and Consistency**: Automated tests ensure that the solutions behave consistently across different environments and scenarios, reducing the risk of unexpected failures.
- **Efficiency and Speed**: By automating repetitive testing tasks, you can accelerate the development process and bring solutions to market faster.
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated testing provides a robust framework for validating the functionality and performance of the solutions, ensuring that they meet the defined requirements.
- **Resource Optimization**: Automated testing reduces the need for extensive manual testing, allowing your team to focus on more strategic tasks.

## Conclusion

As a Business Unit Lead, your role is to ensure that the solutions developed on the Power Platform align with the strategic objectives of your business unit and deliver measurable value. By advocating for and overseeing the implementation of automated testing practices, you can ensure that the solutions are reliable, performant, and meet the required standards. This not only supports business continuity but also demonstrates the impact and quality of the solutions created.
