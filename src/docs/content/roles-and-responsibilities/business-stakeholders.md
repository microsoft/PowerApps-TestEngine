As a business stakeholder, your role is pivotal in ensuring the success of low-code solutions within your organization. You have invested in the Power Platform with the expectation that it will drive business continuity, enhance solution performance, and mitigate security risks. Your oversight is crucial in aligning these solutions with the broader business objectives and ensuring that they deliver the expected value.

## Interests and Oversight

### Business Continuity

One of your primary concerns is business continuity. You need to ensure that the solutions developed on the Power Platform are reliable and can withstand various operational challenges. Automated testing plays a critical role in this aspect by providing a safety net that ensures new features do not disrupt existing functionality. This continuous validation helps maintain the stability and reliability of the solutions, thereby supporting uninterrupted business operations.

### Solution Performance

Performance is another key area of interest. You want to ensure that the solutions perform the expected tasks efficiently and effectively. Automated testing helps in identifying performance bottlenecks early in the development process, allowing for timely optimizations. By incorporating performance tests into the automated testing suite, you can ensure that the solutions meet the required performance standards and deliver a seamless user experience.

### Security Risks

Mitigating security risks is a top priority for any business stakeholder. Automated testing includes security tests that validate the application's resilience to various attack scenarios. These tests ensure that the solutions comply with security best practices and protect sensitive business data. By integrating security tests into the automated testing process, you can proactively address potential vulnerabilities and safeguard the organization's assets.

### Empowering Business Users

Low-code solutions offer a scalable way to empower business users to build solutions independently and in coordination with IT development teams or partners. This democratization of development enables faster innovation and reduces the dependency on traditional development resources. However, to ensure the quality and reliability of these solutions, it is essential to implement automated testing practices. This ensures that even solutions developed by non-technical users meet the organization's standards and can be scaled effectively.

## The Need for Automated Testing

Automated testing is not just a technical necessity; it is a strategic imperative for business stakeholders. It provides the following benefits:

- **Consistency and Reliability**: Automated tests ensure that the solutions behave consistently across different environments and scenarios, reducing the risk of unexpected failures.
- **Faster Time to Market**: By automating repetitive testing tasks, you can accelerate the development process and bring solutions to market faster.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Automated testing reduces the need for extensive manual testing, thereby lowering the overall testing costs.
- **Compliance and Auditability**: Automated tests provide a clear audit trail of testing activities, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements and internal policies.

## Conclusion

As a business stakeholder, your role is to ensure that the investments in the Power Platform deliver the expected business value. By advocating for and overseeing the implementation of automated testing practices, you can ensure that the solutions are reliable, performant, and secure. This not only supports business continuity but also empowers business users to innovate confidently and effectively.
