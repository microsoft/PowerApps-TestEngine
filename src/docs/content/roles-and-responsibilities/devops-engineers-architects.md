title: DevOps Engineers / Architects
---

Welcome to the section dedicated to DevOps Engineers and Architects! Here, we'll dive into the roles and responsibilities of these key players in the low-code testing landscape on the Power Platform. Let's explore their interests, oversight, and the crucial need for automated testing.

## Interests and Oversight

As a DevOps Engineer or Architect, your primary focus is on the overall Continuous Integration / Deployment (CI/CD) process. You play a pivotal role in integrating the Power Platform into this process, ensuring that everything runs smoothly from development to deployment. Your responsibilities include:

- **Source Control Integration**: Managing and integrating source control to keep track of changes and maintain version control.
- **Test Assets Management**: Overseeing the creation, maintenance, and execution of test assets to ensure quality and reliability.
- **Quality Processes**: Implementing and managing quality processes to ensure that deployments and updates meet the required standards.

Your oversight extends to ensuring that the Power Platform solutions are seamlessly integrated with other information technology investments, providing a holistic approach to both low-code and code-first solutions.

## The Need for Automated Testing

Automated testing is a game-changer in the world of low code DevOps. It helps in:

- **Efficiency**: Automated tests can be run quickly and repeatedly, saving time and reducing the manual effort required for testing.
- **Consistency**: Automated tests provide consistent results, reducing the risk of human error and ensuring that tests are performed the same way every time.
- **Early Detection**: Automated tests can catch issues early in the development process, allowing for quicker fixes and reducing the impact on the final product.
- **Scalability**: Automated testing can easily scale to accommodate larger projects and more complex testing scenarios, making it an essential tool for DevOps Engineers and Architects.

By embracing automated testing, you can ensure that the Power Platform solutions are robust, reliable, and ready for deployment. This not only enhances the quality of the solutions but also contributes to the overall success of the organization.

## Examples

The following [examples](../examples) could be of interest

| Example | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [CoE Starter Kit Test Automation ALM](../examples/coe-kit-test-automation-alm.md) | The CoE Starter Kit Test Automation ALM aims to maintain quality and reduce manual effort for new releases by automating the release and continuous deployment process. This involves using tools like Power Automate Desktop, Terraform, and the Test Engine to provision environments, install dependencies, and validate setups, ensuring consistent and reliable operations.
| [CoE Starter Kit -  Infrastructure As Code](../examples/coe-kit-infrastructure-as-code.md) | The combination of Terraform and the CoE Starter Kit offers a robust solution for managing Power Platform environments by leveraging infrastructure as code to ensure consistency and reliability. This approach simplifies the setup and maintenance of environments, allowing us to create the foundations of an automated test matrix to test setup and upgrade process.
