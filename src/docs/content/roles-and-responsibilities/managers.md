As a Manager, your role is crucial in ensuring that your team of makers and software developers has the necessary knowledge and training to effectively build and test low-code solutions on the Power Platform. You are responsible for fostering a culture of continuous learning and improvement, ensuring that your team is equipped to meet the evolving demands of the business.

## Interests and Oversight

### Knowledge and Training

One of your primary responsibilities is to ensure that your team has the required knowledge and training to build and test low-code solutions effectively. This involves providing access to training resources, workshops, and hands-on learning opportunities. Automated testing is a critical component of this training, as it equips your team with the skills needed to create reliable and high-quality solutions.

### Succession Planning

Succession planning is essential for maintaining the continuity and scalability of low-code solutions. As a Manager, you need to ensure that successful solutions can be shared among the team and upgraded to support teams as the size, scale, and impact of low-code solutions grow. Automated testing plays a vital role in this process by providing a framework for validating the functionality and performance of solutions, ensuring that they can be maintained and scaled effectively.

### Ensuring Quality and Reliability

Quality and reliability are paramount in any development process. As a Manager, you need to ensure that the solutions developed by your team meet the required standards and deliver consistent results. Automated testing provides a robust framework for validating the functionality and performance of solutions, ensuring that they meet the defined requirements and deliver consistent results.

### Supporting Innovation

Innovation is key to staying competitive in today's fast-paced business environment. By fostering a culture of continuous learning and improvement, you can empower your team to explore new ideas and approaches. Automated testing supports this innovation by providing a safety net that ensures new features do not disrupt existing functionality, allowing your team to experiment and innovate with confidence.

## The Need for Automated Testing

Automated testing is essential for Managers to achieve their goals and support their teams effectively. It provides the following benefits:

- **Consistency and Reliability**: Automated tests ensure that the solutions behave consistently across different environments and scenarios, reducing the risk of unexpected failures.
- **Efficiency and Speed**: By automating repetitive testing tasks, you can accelerate the development process and bring solutions to market faster.
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated testing provides a robust framework for validating the functionality and performance of solutions, ensuring that they meet the defined requirements.
- **Resource Optimization**: Automated testing reduces the need for extensive manual testing, allowing your team to focus on more strategic tasks.

## Conclusion

As a Manager, your role is to ensure that your team has the necessary knowledge and training to build and test low-code solutions effectively. By advocating for and overseeing the implementation of automated testing practices, you can ensure that the solutions developed by your team are reliable, performant, and meet the required standards. This not only supports business continuity but also fosters a culture of innovation and continuous improvement.
