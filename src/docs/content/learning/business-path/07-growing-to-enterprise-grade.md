title: 07 - Growing Solutions to Enterprise Grade
---

As your low code solutions scale, the need for robust testing practices becomes more critical. Growing to enterprise-grade involves adopting a model that can deploy on demand and rapidly respond to new features, errors, or security requirements. This model relies on the confidence provided by automated tests, allowing you to meet business needs while adhering to continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) processes.

## The Enterprise-Grade Model

An enterprise-grade model is designed to handle the complexities and demands of large-scale applications. It ensures that your solutions are sustainable, reliable, secure, and performant, even as they grow in size and complexity. Key components of this model include:

1. **On-Demand Deployment**: The ability to deploy updates and new features quickly and efficiently is crucial for maintaining a competitive edge. Automated testing ensures that these deployments are reliable and do not introduce new issues.
2. **Rapid Response to Changes**: Whether it's a new feature request, a bug fix, or a security update, the ability to respond quickly is essential. Automated tests provide a safety net that allows you to make changes with confidence, knowing that any issues will be caught early.
3. **Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)**: Integrating automated tests into your CI/CD pipeline ensures that every code change is tested and validated before it reaches production. This reduces the risk of defects and ensures that your application remains stable and reliable.

## Benefits of Automated Testing in an Enterprise-Grade Model

Automated testing plays a critical role in achieving and maintaining enterprise-grade quality. Here are some of the key benefits:

1. **Confidence in Deployments**: Automated tests provide assurance that your application will continue to function correctly after each deployment. This confidence allows you to deploy more frequently and with less risk.
2. **Faster Time to Market**: By automating repetitive testing tasks, you can reduce the time required for testing and accelerate the release of new features and updates.
3. **Improved Quality**: Automated tests can cover a wide range of scenarios, including edge cases and negative tests, ensuring that your application is thoroughly tested and of high quality.
4. **Scalability**: Automated testing can handle large volumes of test cases, making it suitable for large-scale applications. It can also be easily scaled to accommodate growing testing needs.

## Conclusion

Growing to enterprise-grade requires a robust testing strategy that includes automated testing. By adopting an enterprise-grade model, you can deploy on demand, respond rapidly to changes, and maintain the confidence provided by automated tests. This approach ensures that your solutions meet business needs while adhering to the expectations of continuous integration and deployment processes.
