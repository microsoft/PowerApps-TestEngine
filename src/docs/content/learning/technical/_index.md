When you're looking to build solutions that require the ability to test them to verify the operation of the deployed solution, the Power Apps Test Engine can be a valuable tool in your Microsoft Power Platform solution. However, creating a manual process can be time-consuming and challenging. The Power Apps Test Engine provides a set of samples and low-code Power Fx statements to help you understand applying testing to Power Apps. You can take advantage of recording capabilities to accelerate your ability to test solutions. This method helps automate your test process, making support and providing a sustainability model for your solution.

## Learning Objectives

This module explains the following concepts:
- Automated testing and its benefits
- How to set up to run your first tests
- How to record a test for a deployed application
