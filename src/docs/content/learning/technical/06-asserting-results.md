## Introduction to Asserts

In automated testing, an **assert** is a statement that checks if a condition is true. If the condition evaluates to true, the test passes; if it evaluates to false, the test fails. Asserts are crucial for verifying that your application behaves as expected.

## The Assert Power Fx Function

The `Assert` function in Power Fx takes two arguments:
1. A boolean expression that evaluates to true or false.
2. A message that describes the assertion.

If the boolean expression evaluates to true, the test step passes. If it evaluates to false, the test step fails, and the provided message helps identify the issue.

### Syntax

```powerfx
Assert(boolean_expression, "message")
```

## Example

Let's consider an example where we want to assert that the value of Label1.Text is equal to "Heading":

{{% powerfx-interactive %}}
// Setup simulated Label Control with Text Value to check below
SetProperty(Label1.Text, "Heading");

Assert(Label1.Text = "Heading", "Unexpected header value")
{{% /powerfx-interactive %}}

#### Tell Me More

In this example using the **Assert()** function, if Label1.Text is "Heading", the test step will pass. If it is not, the test step will fail, and the message "Label1 should display 'Heading'" will be shown.

## Using Assert in a Test Plan

In the [testPlan.fx.yaml](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-TestEngine/blob/main/samples/buttonclicker/testPlan.fx.yaml) file, you can include assert statements to validate your application's behavior. Let's look at an example from the Button Clicker sample.

### Steps to Use Assert in Your Test Plan

1. Open the testPlan.fx.yaml File:

2. Navigate to the \samples\buttonclicker\ directory.

3. Open the testPlan.fx.yaml file in a text editor.

4. Add or chage an Assert Statement:

    ```powerfx
    Assert(Label1.Text = "Heading", "Label1 should display 'Heading'")
    ```

5. Save the changes to the testPlan.fx.yaml file.

6. Run the test script by executing:

    ```pwsh
    pwsh -File RunTests.ps1
    ```

7. Review the Results:

After the test completes, review the results in the TestOutput folder.

Check the .trx file and individual test case folders to see if the assert statements passed or failed.

By using assert statements in your test plans, you can ensure that your application behaves as expected and quickly identify any issues that need to be addressed.

## Summary

In this section, you learned how to use assert statements in automated testing to verify that your application behaves as expected. By including assert statements in your test plans, you can quickly identify any issues and ensure that your application meets the desired criteria. This process involves adding assert statements to your test plan, running the test script, and reviewing the results to confirm that the assertions pass or fail.
