A Git branch allows you to create a separate line of development, where you can make changes, experiment, and test new features without altering the main project.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-use-branches">Why Use Branches?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Branches are incredibly useful for several reasons:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why Automated Testing?</title><link>https://microsoft.github.io/PowerApps-TestEngine/context/why-automated-testing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://microsoft.github.io/PowerApps-TestEngine/context/why-automated-testing/</guid><description>&lt;p>Automated testing is a cornerstone of modern software development, ensuring that applications are &lt;a href="https://microsoft.github.io/PowerApps-TestEngine/PowerApps-TestEngine/discussion/building-a-sustainability-model/">sustainable&lt;/a>, reliable, secure, and performance. In the context of low-code Power Platform solutions, automated testing becomes even more critical due to the rapid development cycles and the need for enterprise-grade reliability.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="learned-expectations-of-automated-testing">Learned Expectations of Automated Testing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In traditional software development, automated testing has proven to be invaluable for catching bugs early, reducing manual testing efforts, and ensuring consistent quality. These benefits are equally applicable to low-code solutions, where the speed of development can sometimes lead to overlooked issues. Automated tests provide a safety net, ensuring that new features do not break existing functionality and that the application remains robust as it evolves.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why Not Just Manual Testing</title><link>https://microsoft.github.io/PowerApps-TestEngine/context/why-not-just-manual-testing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://microsoft.github.io/PowerApps-TestEngine/context/why-not-just-manual-testing/</guid><description>&lt;p>Imagine an error occurs outside normal operating hours, and the person who created the application is on holiday. How can you effectively diagnose the problem, propose changes, and deploy with confidence that the solution will continue to work? This example demonstrates the limitations of relying solely on manual testing and developing a comprehensive &lt;a href="https://microsoft.github.io/PowerApps-TestEngine/PowerApps-TestEngine/discussion/implementing-effective-automated-testing-strategies-in-power-platform-solutions/">testing strategy&lt;/a> as applications reach toward enterprise-grade impact.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="limitations-of-manual-testing">Limitations of Manual Testing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Manual testing involves human testers executing test cases without the assistance of tools or scripts. While this approach can be effective for certain types of testing, such as usability and exploratory testing, it has several limitations:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why Not Just Use Code First Testing Tools</title><link>https://microsoft.github.io/PowerApps-TestEngine/context/why-not-just-use-code-first-testing-tools/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://microsoft.github.io/PowerApps-TestEngine/context/why-not-just-use-code-first-testing-tools/</guid><description>&lt;p>For many code-first developers, the initial inclination is to use familiar code-first testing tools like &lt;a href="https://microsoft.github.io/PowerApps-TestEngine/PowerApps-TestEngine/discussion/playwright-vs-test-engine/">Playwright&lt;/a> when working with low-code solutions. While this approach might seem logical, it can present several challenges, particularly in terms of scalability and efficiency.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="scale-issues-and-resource-constraints">Scale Issues and Resource Constraints&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Code-first testing tools often require specialized skills and knowledge, which can be in relatively short supply. This scarcity of resources can create bottlenecks in the testing process, as there may not be enough skilled testers available to meet the demands of large-scale projects. This limitation can slow down the development cycle and delay the release of new features and updates.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
