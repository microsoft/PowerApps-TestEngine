# Test Authoring

The following test authoring method exist for different personas to create and edit tests:

| Method| Description |	Considerations
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| Test Studio| Record of test and export as Test Engine Yaml |	1.	Limitations in support as documented in [Test Studio - Power Apps \| Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/test-studio#known-limitations)
| Visual Studio Code Extension	| Experimental Visual Studio Code extension that offers Text Completion and Syntax validation | 1.	Extension are still work in progress
| | | 2.	More likely to meet the skill level of advanced makers and code first developers
| AI Generated Tests | Use of Generative AI to define test cases and test steps |1.	AI Generated tests is not yet a Generally available feature.

## Generative AI in Testing

Generative AI can be used to create test cases, automate repetitive tasks, and analyze test results, enhancing efficiency and accuracy across the board. By using Generative AI the process of creating and editing tests for each persona can be simplified and augumented to improve and maintain test coverage.

NOTE: 
1. This is an area of active research and development by the Power Platform Engineering team and arguments the ability to author and maintain tests without needing deep testing expertise.
