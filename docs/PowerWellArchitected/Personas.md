# Role of Test Personas

## Different Test Personas

Different people, ranging from "code-first" testers to members of the maker community, will play distinct roles in the testing process:
-	Code-First Testers: Developers with a deep understanding of testing methodologies and tools.
-	Maker Community: Business users with limited technical knowledge who can leverage low-code/no-code testing tools.

Scalability is achieved by providing appropriate tools and training for each person, enabling them to contribute effectively to the testing process. Depending on the team and the technology landscape they could look to mix and match different elements to best support their quality strategy

| Key Elements	| Code-First Testers|	Maker Community  |

| Tooling|	Local editors (e.g., Visual Studio, VS Code)|Browser-based record and authoring tools
|Execution	| Integrated into CI/CD tooling	| Low Code deployment pipelines
