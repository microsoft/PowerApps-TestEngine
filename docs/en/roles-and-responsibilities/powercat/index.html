<h1 id="power-customer-advisory-team-power-cat">Power Customer Advisory Team (Power CAT)</h1>
<p>Welcome to the section dedicated to the <a href="https://aka.ms/whoispowercat">Power Customer Advisory Team</a> (Power CAT)! We are part of the Microsoft Power Platform engineering team, and our mission is to ensure the success of our key enterprise customers with the Power Platform. Let&rsquo;s dive into who we are, what we do, and how we interact with various roles to help people be successful, especially in the context of automated testing.</p>
<h2 id="who-we-are">Who We Are</h2>
<p>We are a diverse group of technical architects, community managers, program managers, developers, and content creators, located all over the world. Our shared passion for the possibilities of low-code drives us to work closely with a specific group of key enterprise customers, doing whatever it takes to ensure their success with the Power Platform.</p>
<h2 id="coe-kit-and-test-automation">CoE Kit and Test Automation</h2>
<p>The Center of Excellence (CoE) Starter Kit has evolved over 4 years. It includes a wide range of components of the Power Platform, which is a suite of applications, connectors, and a data platform (Dataverse) that provides a rapid development environment to build custom apps for your business needs.</p>
<h3 id="components-of-the-coe-starter-kit">Components of the CoE Starter Kit</h3>
<p>As shown in <a href="/PowerApps-TestEngine/examples/coe-kit-automate-test-sample/">CoE Kit Automated Test</a> we have many components of our end to end solution to test including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Power Apps</strong>: These are applications built using the Power Platform. There are two types of Power Apps included in the CoE Starter Kit:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Canvas Apps</strong>: These apps allow you to design and build a user interface by dragging and dropping elements onto a canvas, similar to designing a slide in PowerPoint. You can connect to various data sources and use Excel-like expressions to add logic and functionality.</li>
<li><strong>Model-Driven Apps</strong>: These apps are built on top of Dataverse and are more data-centric. They automatically generate a user interface based on the data model you define, making it easier to create complex applications without extensive coding.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Power Automate Cloud Flows</strong>: Power Automate is a service that helps you create automated workflows between your favorite apps and services to synchronize files, get notifications, collect data, and more. Cloud Flows are workflows that run in the cloud and can be triggered by various events, such as new environments being added to Dataverse after calling Administration connectors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dataverse</strong>: Dataverse the scalable data service and app platform that we used to securely store and manage inventory and usage data used by the kit. It provides a common data model that allows you to integrate data from multiple sources and create a unified view of your business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Creator Kit</strong>: The Creator Kit is a set of tools and components that help you build custom user interfaces in Power Apps. It makes use of PCF (PowerApps Component Framework), which allows developers to create reusable components using standard web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These components can be used to enhance the functionality and appearance of your Power Apps.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="importance-of-automated-testing">Importance of Automated Testing</h3>
<p>Given the complexity and wide range of components included in the CoE Starter Kit, automated testing is essential to ensure the quality and reliability of the solution. The CoE Starter Kit is used by thousands of customers globally and needs to be updated frequently to incorporate new product features. Additionally, it needs to be tested across many geographies around the world to ensure consistent performance and reliability.</p>
<p>Automated testing helps in:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ensuring Consistency</strong>: Automated tests can be run frequently to ensure that new changes do not introduce regressions and that the solution remains stable over time.</li>
<li><strong>Saving Time and Resources</strong>: Automated tests can execute repetitive tasks quickly and accurately, freeing up human testers to focus on more complex and exploratory testing.</li>
<li><strong>Improving Reliability</strong>: Automated tests can catch bugs early in the development cycle, reducing the cost and complexity of fixing issues later in the process.</li>
</ul>
<p>By leveraging automated testing, the CoE Starter Kit can maintain its high standards of quality and continue to meet the needs of its global user base.</p>
