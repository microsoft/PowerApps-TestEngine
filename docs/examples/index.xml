&lt;ol>
&lt;li>How do we collaborate with the Test Engine team to improve the Test Engine?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How do we setup and install the solution?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Could we automate the creation of the environment, install of dependencies, setup of connections?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How we extend testing a Model Driven Application with custom pages?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How do we handle the user consent dialog?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How build tests to interact with a complicated multi stage setup process?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How can we create integration tests calling Power Automate Cloud Flows?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How can we validating the successful setup and state with Dataverse?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How can we scale what we are learning to improve guidance?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="early-adopter-and-build-from-source">Early Adopter and Build from Source&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We collaborated closely with the Test Engine team by contributing code to the repository to use a &lt;a href="https://microsoft.github.io/PowerApps-TestEngine/PowerApps-TestEngine/examples/coe-kit-build-from-source-run-tests/">build from source&lt;/a> strategy. This included adding new code for authentication, providers for the Model Driven app, and expanding Power Fx functions to make testing easier. By building the open source from code, we applied a build process to integrate tests as part of our deployment process. This ensured that our tests were consistently run and validated during each deployment.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CoE Starter Kit - Infrastructure As Code</title><link>https://microsoft.github.io/PowerApps-TestEngine/examples/coe-kit-infrastructure-as-code/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://microsoft.github.io/PowerApps-TestEngine/examples/coe-kit-infrastructure-as-code/</guid><description>&lt;p>The combination of Terraform and the CoE Starter Kit provides a powerful and flexible solution for managing and governing your Power Platform environments.
