title: 02 - Setting Up People and Processes for Success
---

In this section, we will discuss the key elements required to set up people and processes for success in automated testing. This includes identifying the right team members, defining clear roles and responsibilities, and establishing effective processes to ensure smooth implementation and continuous improvement. We will address the needs of two communities: code-first teams incorporating low code in their solutions, and business-driven testing teams creating low code solutions to solve business needs.

## Identifying the Right Team Members

Automated testing requires a diverse set of skills and expertise. Traditional roles that could be part of your automated testing team:

- **Test Automation Engineer**: Responsible for designing, developing, and maintaining automated test scripts. This role is crucial for code-first teams that integrate low code solutions.
- **Quality Assurance (QA) Analyst**: Ensures that the automated tests meet the required quality standards and cover all necessary test cases. This role is essential for both code-first and business-driven testing teams.
- **Software Developer**: Collaborates with the test automation engineer to integrate automated tests into the development process. This role is more prominent in code-first teams.
- **Low Code Developer**: Focuses on creating and maintaining low code solutions that meet business needs. This role is vital for business-driven testing teams.
- **Project Manager**: Oversees the entire automated testing project, ensuring that it stays on track and meets business objectives. This role is important for both communities.
- **Business Analyst**: Provides insights into business requirements and ensures that the automated tests align with business goals. This role is crucial for business-driven testing teams.

## Business Roles

In addition to traditional test roles, it is important to consider business-driven development using low code Power Platform. Here are some key business roles:

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Business Stakeholders** | Represents business stakeholders who have invested in the Power Platform and want to ensure automated testing is applied at the correct level. They are concerned with business continuity, solution performance, and mitigating security risks. |
| **Business Unit Leads** | Responsible for achieving goals set by business stakeholders and demonstrating the impact and quality of the solutions created. | 
| **Managers** | Ensure that makers or software developers in their teams have the required knowledge and training to effectively build and test solutions. They also focus on succession planning and sharing successful solutions among the team. | 
| **Makers** | Low-code maker community who build solutions using low-code tools to rapidly achieve business goals. They may be unfamiliar with formal testing skills and need low-code testing processes to create sustainable solutions. |
| **Trainers** | Responsible for enterprise training and skilling by role to make the most of low code Power Platform |

## Defining Clear Roles and Responsibilities

To ensure the success of your automated testing efforts, it is crucial to define clear roles and responsibilities for each team member. This helps avoid confusion and ensures that everyone knows what is expected of them. Here are some key responsibilities for each role:

- **Test Automation Engineer**: Develops and maintains automated test scripts, identifies test automation opportunities, and ensures that the automated tests are reliable and efficient.
- **Quality Assurance (QA) Analyst**: Reviews automated test scripts, identifies gaps in test coverage, and ensures that the tests meet quality standards.
- **Software Developer**: Integrates automated tests into the development process, provides feedback on test scripts, and collaborates with the test automation engineer to resolve any issues.
- **Low Code Developer**: Develops and maintains low code solutions, ensures that they meet business requirements, and collaborates with the QA analyst to integrate automated tests.
- **Project Manager**: Manages the automated testing project, tracks progress, and ensures that the project stays on schedule and within budget.
- **Business Analyst**: Analyzes business requirements, ensures that the automated tests align with business goals, and provides feedback on test results.
- **Business Stakeholders**: Ensure that automated testing is applied at the correct level, focusing on business continuity, solution performance, and mitigating security risks.
- **Business Unit Leads**: Achieve goals set by business stakeholders and demonstrate the impact and quality of the solutions created.
- **Managers**: Ensure that team members have the required knowledge and training to effectively build and test solutions, focusing on succession planning and sharing successful solutions.
- **Makers**: Build solutions using low-code tools to rapidly achieve business goals, requiring low-code testing processes to create sustainable solutions.
- **Trainers**: Provide enterprise training and skilling by role to make the most of low code Power Platform.

## Establishing Effective Processes

Effective processes are essential for the successful implementation and continuous improvement of automated testing. Here are some key processes to consider:

- **Test Planning**: Define the scope, objectives, and approach for automated testing. This includes identifying the test cases to be automated, selecting the appropriate tools, and setting up the test environment.
- **Test Development**: Develop and maintain automated test scripts, ensuring that they are reliable, efficient, and easy to maintain.
- **Test Execution**: Execute automated tests, monitor their performance, and report any issues or failures.
- **Test Maintenance**: Regularly review and update automated test scripts to ensure that they remain effective and relevant.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Continuously evaluate and improve your automated testing processes, incorporating feedback from team members and stakeholders.

## Leveraging Low Code Testing Approaches

Incorporating low code testing approaches can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of your automated testing efforts. Here are some strategies to consider:

- **Record and Replay Strategies**: Utilize record and replay tools to capture user interactions and create automated test scripts. This approach is particularly useful for low code solutions, as it allows for quick and easy test creation without extensive coding knowledge.
- **AI-Driven Agents**: Implement AI-driven agents that can observe how the solution is being used and automate the process of generating tests. These agents can identify common usage patterns, detect anomalies, and create test cases that reflect real-world scenarios.
- **Integration with Low Code Platforms**: Ensure that your automated testing tools and processes are seamlessly integrated with low code platforms like Power Platform. This integration allows for continuous testing and validation of low code solutions, ensuring that they meet business requirements and quality standards.

## Adapting to Changing Roles and Requirements

In dynamic environments, team members may change roles, and requirements may evolve. Here are some strategies to ensure that your team can adapt with confidence:

- **Cross-Training**: Encourage team members to learn multiple roles and skills. This ensures that the team can handle changes in roles and responsibilities smoothly.
- **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation of processes, test scripts, and business requirements. This helps new team members get up to speed quickly and ensures continuity.
- **Agile Practices**: Adopt agile practices to respond to changing requirements effectively. This includes regular sprint planning, reviews, and retrospectives to ensure continuous improvement.
- **Collaboration Tools**: Use collaboration tools to facilitate communication and knowledge sharing among team members. This helps ensure that everyone is on the same page and can react quickly to changes.
