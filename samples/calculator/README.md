# Different Variants of the Calculator Sample

The Calculator sample has two variants - one for `en-US` and another for locales that use commas `","` and periods `"."` differently. See below for usage -

1. The [testPlan.fx.yaml](testPlan.fx.yaml) sample supports the default number representation and is to be used with the [Calculator_1_0_0_2.zip](Calculator_1_0_0_2.zip) solution.
1. The [testPlanWithCommaForDecimal.fx.yaml](testPlanWithCommaForDecimal.fx.yaml) sample uses commas `","` for decimals and periods `"."` for thousand separator and supports locales such as some EU locales where this number format is used. This sample is to be used with the [Calculator2_1_0_0_2.zip](Calculator2_1_0_0_2.zip) solution to support this variation.
