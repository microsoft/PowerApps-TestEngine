  # This sample has been written to demonstrate tests written in regions that use commas ',' instead of 
  # periods '.' for a decimal separator. E.g., "10,22" instead of "10.22". However since all of our tests 
  # run in an en-US locale, string representations of the numbers still use the en-US variant i.e., the 
  # number 10,22 is represented in a Label field in the Power App as "10.22". See README for more details.
